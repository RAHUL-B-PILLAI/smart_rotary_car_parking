# SMART ROTARY CAR PARKING PROJECT USING ARDUINO

This projects aims to provide a smart solution to car parking problem in
crowded cities by constructing a vertical rotary car parking system. This project
is an effort to create a prototype of above solution using arduino and other sensor 
along with required components.

# REQUIRED COMPONENTS

* Arduino nano
* Stepper Motor
* A3967(stepper motor driver)
* Ir sensors
* Servo
* PN532 v3 rfid module
* Rfid tags
